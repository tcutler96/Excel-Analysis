# Excel Analysis
This project uses bike sales data to build a clear Excel dashboard. The work began with data cleaning to fix missing values, reshape columns, and keep the file consistent. Pivot tables were then used to explore trends such as sales by region and customer groups, while formulas and lookups helped keep the data accurate and easy to update.

## Dashboard
The dashboard includes charts, graphs, and conditional formatting to highlight important values and show patterns at a glance. The aim was to create a simple tool that anyone can use to explore the dataset and understand the main trends with no extra setup.
